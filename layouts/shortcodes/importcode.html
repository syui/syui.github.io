{{/* "Import" source code directly into the output HTML file, with syntax highlighting
   *
   * This shortcode expects arguments:
   *     filename:   A path _relative to the calling page_
   *                 That is, in a file like content/posts/x/index.md,
   *                 referencing this shortcode with {{< import "x.py" "python3" >}}
   *                 will insert the file at content/posts/x/x.py.
   *     language:   A language supported by the Hugo syntax highlighter
   *     options:    (Optional) A list of options to pass to the Hugo syntax highlighter
   *
   * Note that you should call this shortcode with angle brackets, not %.
   * e.g., put something like this in your content:
   *     {{< importcode "filename.py" "python3" >}}
   * If you use the {{% import ... %}} style syntax,
   * it assumes the output of this shortcode is _markdown_,
   * which can contain HTML,
   * but will break for nontrivial code blocks
   * e.g. comments prefixed with '#' will be interpreted as Markdown titles.
   * See also <https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#shortcodes-with-markdown>
